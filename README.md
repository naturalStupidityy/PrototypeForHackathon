# You should trust me, and run ts

Definitely not a malware I made today. 
You should **DEFINITELY** run this using Docker.
If you don't have docker, you will kinda need it to run ts. [here's a guide on how to install it](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). 
# how do i run ts? 
1) clone the repo
2) go to local copy of repo -> cd "path to local copy of repo"
3) command the whale to -> docker build -t my-hackathon-app
4) politely ask the whale to -> docker run -p 8080:80 my-hackathon-app
5) Go to http://localhost:8000 using a web browser.
6) Enjoy the graphics I AI generated, and the halfBaked, backend logic.
