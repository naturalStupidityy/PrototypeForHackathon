# NAMASTE-FHIR Terminology Mapping Service - Interaction Design

## Core Interactive Components

### 1. Interactive Mapping Visualization
**Purpose**: Display bidirectional mappings between NAMASTE and ICD-11-TM2 terminologies
**Interaction Flow**:
- Left panel: Searchable NAMASTE terminology tree with autocomplete
- Center panel: Static network visualization showing mapping relationships
- Right panel: ICD-11-TM2 terminology details and validation status
- Users can click on any node to see detailed mapping information
- Nodes remain static as per UX handbook guidelines
- Color coding: Green (validated), Amber (pending validation), Red (conflict)

### 2. Smart Search & Autocomplete System
**Purpose**: Enable semantic search with phonetic matching for terminology lookup
**Interaction Flow**:
- Search bar supports multiple input methods (English, Sanskrit, phonetic)
- Real-time autocomplete with ranked suggestions
- Filter options: System type (AYUSH/Modern), Validation status, Category
- Search results display with confidence scores and mapping status
- Click on result to navigate to mapping visualization

### 3. Mapping Validation Interface
**Purpose**: Allow experts to validate and approve terminology mappings
**Interaction Flow**:
- Validation dashboard showing pending mappings
- Side-by-side comparison of source and target terminologies
- Expert can add justification notes and confidence levels
- Batch validation options for similar mappings
- Audit trail display showing validation history

### 4. Data Export & Reporting Tool
**Purpose**: Extract current mappings in multiple formats for different use cases
**Interaction Flow**:
- Export format selection (FHIR R4, CSV, JSON, DHIS2)
- Filter by mapping status, system, validation date
- Preview export before download
- Scheduled export options for regular reporting
- Integration with DHIS2 for direct surveillance data export

## User Journey Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Clinical Researcher Mapping AYUSH to ICD-11
1. Researcher searches for "Sandhigatavata" in search bar
2. Autocomplete suggests "Sandhigatavata (osteoarthritis) - AAE-16"
3. System displays mapping to ICD-11 with validation status
4. Researcher can view detailed justification and confidence score
5. Option to export mapping data for research purposes

### Scenario 2: AYUSH Practitioner Validating Mappings
1. Practitioner accesses validation dashboard
2. Reviews pending mappings in their specialty area
3. Uses side-by-side comparison to verify accuracy
4. Adds expert notes and approves/rejects mappings
5. System updates validation status and audit trail

### Scenario 3: Health Administrator Exporting Surveillance Data
1. Administrator selects DHIS2 export option
2. Filters by validated mappings only
3. Reviews export preview with mapping statistics
4. Confirms export and data is formatted for DHIS2
5. System logs export activity for audit purposes
